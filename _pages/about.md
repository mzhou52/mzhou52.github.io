I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Prof. Leyla Isik](https://www.isiklab.org/). My research focuses on using computational models to understand high-level human vision. Previously, I worked on exploring the computation mechanisms of object perception in the ventral visual pathway. In my Ph.D. research, I plan to focus more on the lateral visual pathway, particularly on social action perception.

In addition to these research interests, I have contributed to the development of large-scale naturalistic neuroimaging datasets, including:
[**Natural Object Dataset (NOD)**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02471-x) for object perception and [**Human Action Dataset (HAD)**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02325-6) for action perception. 

Prior to joining JHU, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from Beijing Normal University (2018‚Äì2025), advised by Prof. Zonglei Zhen and Prof. Youyi Liu. I also had a remote internship (2024‚Äìpresent) with [Prof. Martin Hebart](https://hebartlab.com/) and Dr. Tonghe Zhuang (postdoctoral researcher) at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences.
